				<td bgcolor="ffcce7"> <font face="Georgia" color="4d5198"> In general, I do do believe the 16 personality test <br>
				carries some validity. Their concept is based on the <br>
				Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, a mother-daughter invention <br>
				inspired by the works of the psychologist Carl Jung, and <br>
				seeks to help people understand their tendencies and <br>
				choose more appropriate jobs. One should note, however, <br>
				that while being the most popular method of personality <br>
				quizzes, there's a significant discrepancy within <br>
				scientific results. Even more so, the idea of neatly <br>
				organizing into neat boxes a concept as robust and <br>
				fluid as the human persona.As many a psychologists <br>
				refute the MBTI as they do utilize it as a first step <br>
				to garner a more general idea of an individual's <br>
				personality. So, while not 100% accurate, I believe <br>
				it's a foot i the right direction on assessing <br>
				the type of individual we currently subcribe to be. <br> <br>
